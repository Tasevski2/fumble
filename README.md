# Fumble ðŸ§¹ â€” Swipe Your Bags Into USDT

**Swipe left on your bags.** Fumble is a mobile-first wallet cleanse: it scans your EVM addresses, turns each token into a card, and lets you **swipe to purge** the junkâ€”then sells those picks **sameâ€‘chain â†’ USDT**.

## What it does
- **Scans** your EVM wallets and finds the stuff you forgot you owned.
- **Lets you swipe**: left to dump a token, right to keep coping.
- **Queues a purge** of your leftâ€‘swipes and **converts them to USDT** on the same chain.
- **Shows receipts** so you can celebrate the dollars rescued from the ruins.

## Why youâ€™ll like it
- **Left-swipe your regrets** â€” ruthless, fast, weirdly cathartic.
- **No crossâ€‘chain drama** â€” it keeps sales on the chain where the token lives.
- **Judge first, commit later** â€” swipe through everything before you pull the trigger.
